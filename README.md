# wisemapping-frontend

This monorepo uses lerna and contains all the packages that compose the wisemapping frontend.

This is a WIP migration from [legacy wisemapping](https://bitbucket.org/wisemapping/wisemapping-open-source/) into a modern web development project with multiple improvements.

`nvm use`
`yarn install`
`yarn bootstrap`
`yarn run build`
